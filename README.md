# React Artistique Platform

**React Artistique Platform** is a web application that extends the functionality of the original **React Artistique** project by integrating user authentication, a Strapi database, and additional features like artwork management, collections, and user profiles. This platform allows users to create, save, and share their artworks, as well as interact with others' creations in a collaborative art community.

## Features

* **User Authentication**: Sign-up and login functionality to access personalized accounts.
* **Artwork Creation & Management**:
  * Users can create new SVG-based artwork by customizing shapes, text, colors, and more.
  * Once saved, the artwork is securely stored in the Strapi database and can be edited later exclusively by its creator.
* **Artwork Browsing & Filtering**:
  * Users can view a list of all saved artworks, including those created by others.
  * Filter through artworks based on title or description for easy navigation.
* **Collections**:
  * Users can create collections from all artworks in the database.
* **User Profiles**:
  * Each user has a profile page displaying their information and artworks.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: React, JSX, CSS
* **Backend & Database**: Strapi
* **Routing**: React Router
* **Bundling**: Vite
